# Ring Oscillator Based PUF

- What are PUF?
PUF stands for Physically Unclonable Functions. They are used as the "fingerprints" of electronics devices, to ensure there is no tempering done in any componenet of the circuit.

- Here, we will focus on a type of PUF called the Ring Oscillator PUF. It uses a ring Oscillator (chain of inverter gates) at its core principle.
